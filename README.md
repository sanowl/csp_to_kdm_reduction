# CSP to k-Dimensional Matching Reducer

Implements the reduction from R-degree bounded k-CSP to k-Dimensional Matching as described in:

Lee, E., Svensson, O., & Thiery, T. (2024). Asymptotically Optimal Hardness for k-Set Packing and k-Matroid Intersection. arXiv:2409.17831v1

## Purpose
Demonstrates the theoretical hardness of k-Dimensional Matching by reducing from CSP.

## Key Features
- Converts CSP instances to k-Dimensional Matching instances
- Preserves problem difficulty in the transformation
- Verifies properties of the resulting instance

Note: For theoretical study, not practical problem-solving.
